<h2>Service Dependencies</h2>

<p>
    The Nimbus service node interacts with clients and manages backend hypervisor nodes. We strive to make it as simple
    as possible to install and configure, but there are a few system dependencies and requirements you will need.
</p>


<h3>Sun Java 1.5 or later</h3>
<p>
    The <span class="pre">java</span> command should be on your path. You can check your
    Java version with this command:
</p>
<pre><div class="screen">
$ java -version
</div></pre>
        
<p>
    Note that OpenJDK is not supported.
</p>

<h3>Python 2.5 or later</h3>
<p>
    sqlite3, openssl, blah, blah, blah TODO
</p>
        
<h3>Apache Ant 1.6.2 or later</h3>
<p>
    You must also have the <span class="pre">propertyfile</span> task available which
    is usually installed separately from Ant itself. On Redhat-compatible systems this is often a package called
    <span class="pre">ant-nodeps</span>. On Debian/Ubuntu the package is <span class="pre">ant-optional</span>. You can
    check your ant installation:
</p>
<pre><div class="screen">
$ ant -diagnostics

------- Ant diagnostics report -------
Apache Ant version 1.6.5

-------------------------------------------
 Implementation Version
-------------------------------------------
core tasks     : 1.6.5
optional tasks : 1.6.5
...
</div></pre>
<p>
    If the "optional tasks" line does not say "not available", you should have everything needed.
</p>

<p>
    If you have all of these dependencies, you can safely move on to the next section,
    <a href="service-setup.html">Service Installation</a>.
