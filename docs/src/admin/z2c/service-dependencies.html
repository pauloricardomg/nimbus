<h2>Service Dependencies</h2>

<p>
    The Nimbus service node interacts with clients and manages backend hypervisor nodes. We strive to make it as simple
    as possible to install and configure, but there are a few system dependencies and requirements you will need.
</p>


<h3>Sun Java 1.5 or later</h3>
<p>
    The <tt class="literal">java</tt> command should be on your path. You can check your
    Java version with this command:
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ java -version
</pre>
        
<p>
    Note that OpenJDK is not supported.
</p>

<h3>Python 2.5 or later</h3>
<p>
    Your Python must have support for <tt class="literal">sqlite 2</tt>, which is often installed separately, in a
    package called <tt class="literal">python-sqlite2</tt> (Redhat) or <tt class="literal">python-pysqlite2</tt>
    (Debian). The versioning is confusing for this package
    and the module we actually need is called <tt class="literal">sqlite3</tt>, so the best way to check for availability
    is with this command. if you don't get an error, you are in good shape.
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ python -c "import sqlite3"
</pre>

<h3>GCC</h3>
<p>
    Cumulus is bundled with several other Python dependencies, some of which require building from source (C). This
    requires <tt class="literal">gcc</tt>. If you cannot install gcc, you can get around the requirement by directly
    installing these Python packages to your system: <tt class="literal">pyopenssl</tt> and
    <tt class="literal">Twisted 10.0.0</tt>.
</p>

        
<h3>Apache Ant 1.6.2 or later</h3>
<p>
    You must also have the <tt class="literal">propertyfile</tt> task available which
    is usually installed separately from Ant itself. On Redhat-compatible systems this is often a package called
    <tt class="literal">ant-nodeps</tt>. On Debian/Ubuntu the package is <tt class="literal">ant-optional</tt>. You can
    check your ant installation:
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ ant -diagnostics

------- Ant diagnostics report -------
Apache Ant version 1.6.5

-------------------------------------------
 Implementation Version
-------------------------------------------
core tasks     : 1.6.5
optional tasks : 1.6.5
...
</pre>
<p>
    If the "optional tasks" line does not say "not available", you should have everything needed.
</p>

<p>
    If you have all of these dependencies, you can safely move on to the next section,
    <a href="service-setup.html">Service Installation</a>.
