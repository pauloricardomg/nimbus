<h2>Service Installation</h2>

<p>
    On this page, you will install the Nimbus central services and
    image repository (<i>Cumulus</i>), and use a cloud
    client to access your cloud as a remote client.
</p>
<p>
    This will however only work in "fake mode" which means that the
    service is only pretending to start VMs.  In later steps you will
    enable VMMs, connect them with the central service, and have a
    working cloud setup.
</p>
<h3>Create User Account</h3>
<p>
    The first step is to create a separate user account under which to
    install and run the Nimbus services. It is not recommended to use
    the root account. Because you will later be configuring password-less
    SSH keys between this account and your hypervisor nodes, it is best
    to use a dedicated account for these services.
</p>
<p>
    In this guide, we will be calling the user
    <span class="pre">nimbus</span>, but you can use anything you like.
</p>
<h3>Download and Install</h3>
<p>
    As the new <span class="pre">nimbus</span> user, fetch and unpack
    the latest service distribution.
</p>

<pre><div class="screen">
$ wget http://www.nimbusproject.org/downloads/nimbus-2.5-src.tar.gz
$ tar xfz nimbus-2.5-src.tar.gz
$ cd nimbus-2.5-src/
</div></pre>

<p>
    You must now choose an installation directory. It could be within
    the <span class="pre">nimbus</span> user home directory, or something
    like /opt/nimbus. If the directory exists, it must be empty and writable.
    If it does not exist, the parent directory must be writable.
</p>

<p>
    Throughout this guide, we will refer to this installation directory as
    <span class="pre">$NIMBUS_HOME</span>. To install, run this command from
    the Nimbus source directory (specifying your chosen destination):
</p>
<pre><div class="screen">
$ ./install $NIMBUS_HOME
</div></pre>

<div class="note">
    If you need to specify a non default Python, you can do so by setting the
    <span class="pre">PYTHON</span> environment variable. For example if you
    are using RHEL5 and cannot upgrade the system Python to 2.5+, you can
    install Python separately and specify
    <span class="pre">PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python2.5</span> for installation.
</div>

<p>
    The installer performs several steps:

    <li>TODO</li>
