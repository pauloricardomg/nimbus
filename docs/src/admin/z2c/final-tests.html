<h2>Final Tests</h2>

<p>
    On this page, you will remotely test the system with the cloud
    client like you did before.  But this time, a virtual machine
    will be started for you as expected.
</p>

<h3>Back to the cloud client</h3>
<p>
    Several pages ago, we set up and tested the cloud client against
    the service. Now we are ready to revisit that client installation
    and try again, but with a real VM. First off, run the status
    and list commands to ensure that the IaaS and repository services
    are still running correctly.
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ cd nimbus-cloud-client/
</pre>
<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/grid-proxy-init.sh
</pre>
<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --status

Querying for ALL instances.

There's nothing running on this cloud that you own.
</pre>

<pre class="panel">
$ bin/cloud-client.sh --list

No files.
</pre>

<p>
    If these commands succeeded, we can move on and attempt to upload a
    real VM image to the repository.
</p>
<h3>Upload image</h3>

<p>It is recommended to start with the
    <tt class="literal">nimbus-z2c</tt> image that you used earlier to
    test the VMM. If you don't still have it, fetch it again.
</p>
<div class="panel"><pre>
$ wget http://www.nimbusproject.org/downloads/nimbus-z2c.gz
$ gunzip nimbus-z2c.gz
</pre></div>
<p>
    Now use the cloud-client to upload the VM image to the Cumulus repository.
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --transfer --sourcefile nimbus-z2c

Transferring
  - Source: nimbus-z2c
  - Destination: cumulus://Repo/VMS/04NjWi75iz1TzNf4Y3zvU/nimbus-z2c
</pre>

<p>
    Now the list operation should show the new image.
</p>

<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --list

[Image] 'nimbus-z2c'                     Read/write
        Modified: Jun 7 2010 @ 12:43   Size: 288358400 bytes (~275 MB)
</pre>
<h3>Start VM</h3>

<p>
    Now we are ready to boot this image and see if we can ssh into it.
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --run --name nimbus-z2c --hours 1

Launching workspace.

Workspace Factory Service:
    https://nimbus.example.edu:8445/wsrf/services/WorkspaceFactoryService

Creating workspace "vm-001"... done.


       IP address: 128.135.125.25
         Hostname: x001.nimbus.example.edu
       Start time: Mon Jul 05 21:27:20 CDT 2010
    Shutdown time: Mon Jul 05 22:27:20 CDT 2010
 Termination time: Mon Jul 05 22:37:20 CDT 2010

Waiting for updates.

</pre>

<p>
    If all goes well, a VM should be booting and its IP should be
    printed to the screen. The client will not exit until the
    image is distributed and the VM is booting. When this happens,
    you can attempt to SSH into the new VM.
</p>

<pre class="panel">
$ ssh root@x001.nimbus.example.edu
</pre>

<p>
    Notice also that a "handle" was printed out to the screen for
    this launch. In the example above, this handle is
    "<tt class="literal">vm-001</tt>". When you are ready to destroy
    a running VM, you do so using this handle.
</p>

<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --terminate --handle vm-001
</pre>

<p>
    The cloud client has many other options and features. For details,
    check <tt class="literal">--help</tt> and the
    <a href="http://www.nimbusproject.org/docs/2.4/clouds/cloudquickstart.html">client quickstart</a>.
