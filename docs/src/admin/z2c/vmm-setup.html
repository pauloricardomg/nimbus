<h2>Install VMM Software</h2>

<p>
    On this page, you will install the Nimbus VMM software
    (<i>workspace-control</i>) and any of its dependencies
    (including Xen or KVM as well as libvirt, if these are not present
    already).
</p>
<p>
    workspace-control contains scripts that will help you test that
    your Xen/KVM/libvirt installation will work with the programmatic
    access patterns that Nimbus uses.
